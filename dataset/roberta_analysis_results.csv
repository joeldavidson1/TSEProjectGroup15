1. Ask the person that threw acid in your face for the brand name of said acid
2. Rinse with a constant steam of 20 minutes worth of clean fresh water about 20 litres or so that you happen to have on you..

"Rip Luke.
Let's put some context into the title of the article because some ppl are bothered by it. I'd say it's fitting to say, ""so called Islamic State"". They aren't a state and don't deserved to be seen as a state/government. They are Daesh. That's the official name that I feel belongs to them. Saying, ""so called"", I think, implies they are illegitimate and not what they say they are. I agree with that.
