"The signage has been willfully negligent by ommission.  ""Danger"" is not enough.  ""Risk of Serious Injury or Death"" is appropriate.  So what's the difference?  People are used to seeing signage in places that probably have a very low risk factor -- automatic garage doors for example.  How many people are seriously injured or KILLED?  So it has become a warning taken tongue-in-cheek by most people.  On the other hand, drivers rushing to cross a railroad track as a train approaches is a counter example of high risk takers.  In this case, it has become sort of a ""tourist site"" to see a congregation of people at the St. Maartin airport.  How long has this been going on?  The government and airport authorities MUST be aware of it.  So, seriously, they can not hire a guard to command people to leave that area?  or to build a larger barricade such as made of solid concrete to deflect the air flow upward?  In fact, the authorities have accepted and therefore encouraged the practice of people coming up to the fence on a regular and constant basis.  This should make the authorities even more at fault than the tourists who probably did not think there is an actual risk of death.  Now, how will their legal system handle this?",-0.11600000000000002,0.169,0.777,0.053,10154890645702217

It was quite a stupid decision to climb the fence, but even this is probably a common activity that generally never results in death. More of a freak accident than a definite way for someone to die. At the very most, the only changes that should be made by the airport / authorities would be to the fence design, making it more difficult for people to climb up. Barricading the area off completely and banning people from the area would be comparable to fencing off a scenic mountain path that hundreds of people like to climb and enjoy safely, but which does produce the occasional fatality when people slip. Just because this area carries a (clearly communicated) risk shouldn't be a reason for the authorities to step in and make adjustments.

Wear sunglasses, faux glasses or real glasses everywhere you go outdoors.
